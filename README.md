# CS_Scientific_Calculator

This is a GUI scientific calculator programmed in Python, complete with special functions a computing scientist or software engineer would find useful. This program allows for expression of unlimited size (limited only by the memory size of the operating PC).

# Progress
The current calculator is fully functional. Currently supports:
- basic arithmetic (int and float)
- multiple brackets/parentheses
- saving and using the previous result
- left/right shift
- bitwise and, or, not
- exponetial, square root
- log base 2
- permutation/combination (x factorial can be entered as xPx)
- mod
- sin, cos, tan

# Operator Priority
The expressions are executed in the following order:
1. parentheses
2. bitwise not, logâ‚‚, sqrt, sin, cos, tan
3. bitwise and, bitwise or
4. left and right shift
5. combination and permutation
6. exponetial and mod
7. multiplication and division
8. addition and subtraction

# Planned Features
- inverse
